A portfolio I made in Vue and uploaded to Github Pages showcasing the projects I've created while also being a project within itself.

Some notable features include: 

* Image compression if necessary 

* Highlighted code segments

* Sorting feature for projects with multiple selections

* Project fade in and appearence change on hover

* Use of navbar for page selection

* Easily closable popup for project information

* Data based approach, with the various parts of each projects being stored in lists to be implemented in code. 

* Custom link detection
